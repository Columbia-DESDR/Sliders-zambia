# Sliders Zambia Deployment

This repository hosts the code for the `Zambia-specific` deployment of the DESDR Sliders project.

Sliders is a web-based analytics platform designed for stakeholders including government officials, researchers, and policymakers who develop insurance programs.  It utilizes actual data from Chirps and Nigeria's administrative regions. The included queries demonstrate the potential for complex real-world data analysis but are illustrative and may differ from those used in full operational deployment.

For more information on the original Sliders platform code which is specifically modified for Zambia, visit the [original repository for Zambia](https://github.com/Columbia-DESDR/Sliders-refactor-zambia).
